# Meal Planner

This is a simple meal planner that I wrote to help me plan my meals for the week. It's a command line tool that
allows you to add meals to a database and then plan them for the week.

## Get started

### Requirements

Make sure you have the following installed on your machine:

-   .NET 7
-   SQLite 3

1. Clone the repo

```shell
git clone https://github.com/dan-koller/mealplanner.net.git
```

2. Restore the dependencies for each project

```shell
dotnet restore
```

3. Run the project

If you're using the dotnet CLI, make sure you are in the directory for the console project and run:

```shell
dotnet run
```

If you're using Visual Studio, make sure you have the console project set as the startup project and then run the
project.

## Usage

You can add new meals, show meals for a category, plan meals for the week, and create a shopping list.

### Add a new meal

```shell
What would you like to do (add, show, plan, save, exit)?
> add
Which meal do you want to add (breakfast, lunch, dinner)?
> lunch
Input the meal's name:

Input the ingredients:
> lettuce, tomato, onion, cheese, olives
The meal has been added!
```

## Database setup

Make sure to have sqlite3 installed on your machine and available in your PATH. You can check if it's installed by
running:

```shell
sqlite3 --version
```

The database and tables will be created automatically when you run the application for the first time.

## Testing

The application is tested using xUnit. To run the tests, make sure you are in the directory for the test project and run:

```shell
dotnet test
```

Or if you're using Visual Studio, make sure you have the test project set as the startup project and then run the tests.
